`analysis_IM_pwrspec`
=====================
21cm intensity map foreground cleaning and power-spectral analysis. This was written to take maps from `https://github.com/kiyo-masui/analysis_IM`, clean them and find their power spectra.

* `core`: basic algegra functions
* `foreground_clean`: clean foregrounds
* `kiyopy`: is a copy of `https://github.com/kiyo-masui/kiyopy`; general utilites
* `map`: dealing with maps, binning optical surveys
* `pipeline`: string together several operations
* `plotting`: plot 3D volumes
* `quadratic_products`: find the power spectrum across various pairs of data
* `simulations`: a fork of `https://github.com/jrs65/simulations_21cm` to simulate signal volumes
* `utils`: supporting functions
